New BSD License Exceptions:
===================
The generic collections code originated from:
http://www.codeplex.com/PowerCollections
And was released under the 
Eclipse Public License (EPL):
http://www.codeplex.com/PowerCollections/Project/License.aspx
Its original Copyright notices (as required by the EPL):
// Written by Peter Golde
// Copyright (c) 2004-2005, Wintellect
 
It has been adapted and integrated
by ee@devfuel.com of http://www.devfuel.com in order to provide additional features. 

To the best of my understanding, it can be re-released under the BSD license although it retains its EPL requirements and benefits as well.
If the BSD license is found to be legally incompatible with the EPL, then its license will revert back to that of the EPL. 
This distinction is submitted for the purpose of providing consistent licensing across diverse projects and is done in due diligence and good will.
 
Thus as a contributor, my contributions are:
Copyright (c) 2007, ee@devfuel.com
And under the new BSD License as stated above.
